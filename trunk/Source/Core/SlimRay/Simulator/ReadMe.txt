when the project is not full, you can build a virtual class  to simulate the real function of a class.
for example:
a data loader simulator may be not a real data loader, it does not load data from DB at all, 
when you call loadFromDB(...) the simulator only return some real data to you, you don't need to know where is it from,
this is enough for you.

and a simulator can help a coder to build hid code faster, by use a simulator class, you do not need to wait another coder's class finish.
so, it's easy to show the whole project in real by use a simulater object.
